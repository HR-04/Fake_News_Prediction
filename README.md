# Fake_News_Prediction

Fake news prediction is an important and challenging problem in today's digital era. The spread of misinformation can have significant consequences, 
including influencing public opinion, affecting elections, and causing social unrest. Machine learning techniques 
can play a crucial role in identifying and mitigating the impact of fake news by automatically classifying news articles as either fake or real.
Here I used **Logistic Regression** to Train the Model

## Objective

 The goal is to build a model that can Predict the news articles as either fake or real based on their text content.
 
 ## Dataset
 The dataset used for training and evaluating the fake news prediction model is not included in this repository. 
 However, you can obtain a suitable dataset from various sources, such as Kaggle (www.kaggle.com), UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php),
 OpenML (www.openml.org).
 Look for datasets that provide labeled news articles, where each article is annotated as either fake or real.
